# config scripts for my vim and emacs setup.

<p> Its branched by the machines i use them on. I prefer vim for quite editing and doing work over ssh and I prefer emacs for working on a single deadicated project.</p>

<p> I learned to touch type over the lockdown and im finding that mixed with the Emacs approach gives a huge productivity boost. I tailored my editors to have minimal distractions but to be easy be able to jump between files. I experimented for a time with code snippets and ctags but it wasnt worth the effort and would often freeze up my ide, I dont use those features much anyway, I prefare to build up the habit of writing good code instead of relying on the editors which can often be wrong or worse think its wrong and make you second guess while you in a flow state.</p>

<p> I also didnt integrate a terminal, i prefare to just custmize my bash and use that instread. Ill include my bash config file here at a later date, atm i need to centralize it i made the mistake of trying to have a consistent config across windows and linux.</p>
